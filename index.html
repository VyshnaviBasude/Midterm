                <p>Hi, I am <b>Albert Einstein</b> I was born in Germany on March 14, 1879, and people often see me as a very important scientist in physics. I'm best known for creating the theory of relativity, which really changed how we understand the world around us in the early 1900s. My famous equation, E = mc<sup>2</sup>, is something a lot of people know about. In 1921, I got the Nobel Prize in Physics because I helped advance physics and discovered the photoelectric effect, which was key to developing quantum theory.</p>
    
                <p>My work has made a big impact on how people think about science. In 1999, a survey by Physics World magazine named me the greatest physicist ever. The year 1905 was special for me because I published four important papers. These papers introduced the idea that light can act like particles, explained how particles move in a fluid, introduced my special theory of relativity, and showed that mass and energy are two forms of the same thing.</p>
                
                <p>In 1915, I added gravity to my theories with the general theory of relativity, and then in 1916, I talked about how the universe is put together and changes over time. In the middle of my career, I also did important work on how atoms move and on light, suggesting that light is made of particles called photons. I started out in what was then the German Empire, but my love for understanding the universe took me far beyond that.</p>

                        <p>In 1901, Albert Einstein received his diploma as a teacher of physics and mathematics. Unable
                            to find a teaching position, he went to work for the Swiss Patent Office. He obtained his
                            doctoral degree in 1905, the same year he published four significant papers, introducing the
                            concepts of special relativity and the photon theory of light.</p>

                            photoelectric effect he introduced the photon theory of light. In his paper "On the
                            Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies," he introduced the concepts of special relativity.</p>

                            a post at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, as a Professor of
                            Theoretical Physics. He gained American citizenship in 1940.</p>

                            He eventually managed to secure a position as a clerk at the Berne Swiss Patent Office. He
                            had plenty of time with this job to reflect and investigate his scientific theories, which
                            ultimately resulted in his contributions to physics.</p>
